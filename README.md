# Sora

Sora is a web-based static site generator. Posts can be created and updated through the web browser. The app creates static HTML files that readers access.

Sora is built with the Lua programming language. Sora is based upon my Wren web publishing app that was created with Perl.

The app offers a REST-based API.

Test site: <http://sora.soupmode.com>.

In nature, a Sora is a water bird that inhabits marshes. It's more often heard than seen. It vocalizes loudly, but it remains secretive, hiding in the vegetaion. Occasionally, I see one wade through shallow water, along the boardwalk at Magee Marsh Wildlife Area.
